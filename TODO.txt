- Need to add one!

Compilation
- Automate SDK directory discovery 
- Support compilation for different device architectures?

GL
- Create a new object - SceneRenderer which takes care of the skybox, floor, etc - instead of it being in flock.cpp...
- Possibly need to sort particles for correct depth rendering (eg. with bilboarded spheres)

CUDA
- Barnes-Hut (GPU Computing Gems, pg.76)
- FMM (GPU Computing Gems, pg. 114)
- Add multi-gpu functionality
		- All data resides in host memory (works great, since it's not bandwidth bound for 4 GPU's)
		- Single host thread manages all devices
		- A stream for each GPU, with appropriate synchronisation
		- Transfer data to rendering GPU and render from PBO

MODELS
- Would be nice to point to one in the cmd-line args
		
MISC
- Add new parameters:
	- Particle speed
	- Scene dimensions (x,y,z)

BUGS
- Dual pos arrays; neaten the code for that (eg. '1' to reset pos might affect wrong array if done at the wrong time).
